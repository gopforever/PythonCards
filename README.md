# CardTrack Pro (Netlify)

A polished Netlify site for serious sports card hobbyists, buyers, and sellers ‚Äî with live pricing from **SportsCardsPro** and a simple inventory tracker saved in your browser.

## Features
- üîé **Fast price search** (players, sets, years, card #) ‚Äî first 20 matches
- üíµ **Live prices** via SportsCardsPro (ungraded + graded fields when available)
- üì¶ **Inventory tracking** with quantities, grade selection, cost basis & notes
- üìà **Portfolio snapshot** ‚Äî items, est. value, cost basis, P/L
- ‚≠ê **Watchlist**
- ‚¨áÔ∏è **Export / Import** your data (JSON)

## How it works
- Frontend: static HTML + Tailwind + vanilla JS
- Pricing API is called via a **Netlify Function** at `/.netlify/functions/prices` which proxies to `https://www.sportscardspro.com/api/*` and **keeps your token private**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Netlify Functions run in Node (JS/TS) ‚Äî Python runtimes aren't supported for Functions. (We still support Python in builds if needed.)

## One‚Äëtime setup
1. **Create a new Netlify site** from this folder (or `netlify init`).
2. In your site **Environment variables**, add:
   - `SPORTSCARDSPRO_TOKEN` = `<your 40‚Äëchar API token>`
3. (Optional) Install the CLI and run locally:
   ```bash
   npm i -g netlify-cli
   netlify dev
   ```
4. **Deploy** ‚Äî pushing to your repo will auto‚Äëdeploy, or run:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```
